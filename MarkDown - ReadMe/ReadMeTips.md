# This is "the Header" with '#' - by Igor

This is a sample readme file for our GitHub Example repo. <br> 
I'm learning MarkDown!
* '#'  for "H1 Headers"
* '##'  for "H2 Header"
* '###'  for "H3 Header"
* '*' for "Topics"
* '---' to creat a line
* '>' for blockQuots
* <'br> is used for breakLines
* '[your Link]''(http://)' is used for "Links", as this one, where we can find a lot of examples on [adam-p/MarkdownCheetSheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#emphasis)

### Examples
* This is ment to be an example
* of Markdown topics
* with a H2 Header <br>
> An example of a BlockQuot
>
> If you double '>' you can have a line between the lines, as I did now!
> -- **Igor** -> to do that, you have to put the name between '**' -> (* *Igor * *)
